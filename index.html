        <p>Open a browser to <strong>www.wrongest.net</strong> and create a game. This will give you a unique URL to pass out to your friends. Anyone who goes to that URL can enter their name, and then will join your lobby. You can adjust settings using the gear button, then hit start game when everyone's ready.</p>

        <p>As the instigator of this stupid thing, you'll start out as the dealer When the dealer hits the button, the next player is given a card and a time limit.</p>
        <p>When you see your card, <i>it's time to say crazy things.</i> Your job is to try to convince the other players that your statement is actually true. Other players can't see your topic at this point, so use whatever method you can to convince others of your statement's underpinning logic. Which is to say, try to invent some logic.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, a statement will be marked "hard", it's worth bonus points.</p>

        <p>Now that you've all said stupid things, it's time to make some decisions. You'll be given a list of the other player's statements, and you must vote for which is the <i>most wrong</i> and the <i>least wrong </i></p>
        <p>Each time your statement is voted <i>least wrong</i>, you'll get a point. Statements voted <i>most wrong</i> are tracked, so that we can pay attention to this sort of thing later.</p>
