        <p>As the instigator of this stupid thing, you'll start out as the dealer When the dealer hits the button, the next player is given a card and a time limit.</p>
        <p>When you see your card, <i>it's time to say crazy things.</i> Your job is to try to convince the other players that your statement is actually true. Other players can't see your statement while you're talking. It's more fun to to keep the topic itself secret, and just dance around the underpinning logic. Which is to say, try to invent some logic.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, a statement will be marked "hard", it's worth bonus points.</p>

        <p>Now that you've all said stupid things, it's time to make some decisions. You'll be given a list of the other player's statements, and you must vote for which is the <i>most wrong</i> and the <i>least wrong </i></p>
        <p>Each time your statement is voted <i>least wrong</i>, you'll get a point. Statements voted <i>most wrong</i> are tracked, so that we can pay attention to this sort of thing later.</p>

        <p>Gameplay continues like this until we can declare a winner and the wrongest statement. You've got the idea by now, so how about you...</p>
