        <p>Open a browser to <strong>www.wrongest.net</strong>, enter in your name and hit create game. This will give you a unique URL to pass out to your friends. Anyone who goes to that URL will join your lobby. The leader can adjust settings using the gear button, then hit start game when everyone's ready.</p>

        <p>All players are given a turn, one player is the dealer. When the dealer hits the button, the next player is given a card and a time limit.</p>
        <p>When you see your card, <i>it's time to say crazy things.</i> Your job is try to convince the other players that your statement (which they cannot see) is actually true. It's more fun to to keep the topic itself secret, just dance around the underpinning logic. Which is to say, try to invent some logic.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, a statement will be marked "hard", that's worth bonus points.</p>

        <p>Now that you've all said stupid things, it's time to make some decisions. You'll be given a list of statements (excluding your own), and you most vote for one <i>most wrong</i> and one <i>least wrong </i>statement. </p>
        <p>Each time your statement is voted <i>least wrong</i>, you'll get a point. Statements voted <i>most wrong</i> are tracked, so that we can pay attention to this sort of thing later.</p>

        <p>Gameplay continues like this until we can declare a winner and the wrongest statement. I think you've got the idea by now, so how about you...</p>
