        p There's a number of ways you can help The Wrongest Words to go from a little weekend project to being the kind of thing that's talked about so often that you end up feeling a little embarassed that you still like it as much as you do. This is a future you can help create.
        h3 Tip us with Flattr
        p We've set up a Flattr account to accept tips for the project. If you aren't familiar, Flattr is a micropayment service that Lemon 
          a(href="http://thefpl.us/wrote/about-flattr") wrote about here
          | , and we're still operating on the assumption that it's a good idea. If you think the game deserves a little money (which will offset server costs), you can hit the flattr button.
        h3 Contribute on GitHub
        p The whole project is up on GitHub and is available for anyone to see. If you have a bug report or suggestion you can 
          a(href="https://github.com/AnotherDole/wrongest/issues") put an issue in
          | , or if you're programmatically inclined, we will take 
          a(href="https://github.com/AnotherDole/wrongest/pulls") pull requests
          |.
        h3 Tell people about the game
        p There's a whole lot of social networks, and you're probably a member of at least one of them. You could use this social network to tell people about the game, or if you're really bold, you could
          i  try
          |  to talk to people in the real world!
        h3#SuggestCard Suggest a card
        p Have your own idea for a card, or maybe lots of ideas for lots of cards? That's terrific, I think I have a suggest a card button around here somewhere. I'm trying to think of... Oh, wait, maybe it's under this paragraph?
